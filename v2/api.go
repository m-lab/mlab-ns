// Package v2 defines the request API for the location service.
//
// While well provisioned, the M-Lab Platform is finite. On occassion, due to
// peak usage, local service outages, or abnormal client behavior the location
// service must decline to schedule new user requests. This is necesssary to
// safegaurd measurement quality of your measurements and those of others. The
// v2 API classifies user requests into three priorities.
//
//  API-key | Access Token | Priority
//  --------------------------------------------------------
//  YES     | YES          | API-Key, High Availability Pool
//  YES     | NO           | API-Key, Best Effort Pool
//  NO      | NO           | Global Best Effort Pool
//
// For highest priority access to the platform, register an API key and use the
// QueryResult.NextRequest.URL when provided.
